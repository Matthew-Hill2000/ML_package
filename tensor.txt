class tensor
private:
  vector values (the stored values at this level)
  
  vector nested_tensors (store the nested tensors)
  
  vector dimensions (the dimensions of the tensor)

public:
  Tensor constructor(
  
  Takes the dimensions as a vector argument

  sets this to the class dimension attribute
  
  if dimensions is 1 need to resize values and set to 0
  
  if not then create a vector of the dimensions except the first dimension and reserve space in nested tensors for the first dimension ammount
  
  then loop through the first dimension and for each one create and add to nested tensor a new Tensor object with the dimensions from the 2nd dimension onward

  need a function to get values using similar recursive calling with subsequent dimensions as the constructor
  need a function to set values using similar recursive calling with subsequent dimensions as the constructor
  need a function to print with similar recursive nature again
